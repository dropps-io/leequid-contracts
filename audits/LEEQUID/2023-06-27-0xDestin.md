## **High-Level Overview:**

The following is an audit of the LEEQUID fork of StakeWise V2 according to the [provided scope](https://github.com/dropps-io/leequid-contracts/blob/0f4541e754dfb5c9f86016b1b474664b9e5c2dda/audit_scoping.md) with a primary focus on staking, activating, and registering validators as well as the rewards system. The review was conducted manually with a focus on smart contract security, including a careful examination of the codebase as well as the use of static analysis tools like Slither, as well as fuzz testing with Echidna.

## **Identified Issues:**

### **Critical:**

No critical issues were found.

### **High:**

No high-severity issues were found.

### **Medium:**

1. **Potential Dilution Attack Vector (Medium Severity):**
   The staking contract allows sending amounts under `minActivatingDeposit`, bypassing the checks in place to prevent staking if the ratio of the active staked validator is out of acceptable range. This could potentially allow for reward dilution and supply dilution as it takes time to activate a validator node. It is recommended to implement a fee to add a cost barrier to prevent frequent repetitive calls or a conditional check if stakesLyxToken is exceeding the current limit.

### **Low:**

No Low-severity issues were found.

## **Recommendations:**

1. **Fuzz Testing:** It is advisable to conduct further fuzz testing to discover potential edge cases that could result in unanticipated behavior.
2. **Bug Bounty Program:** Establishing a bug bounty program can incentivize the discovery of possible security issues, thereby aiding in unearthing and addressing any undetected bugs or security vulnerabilities.
3. **Rate Limiting:** Consider implementing rate limiting within the contract to prevent repeated, rapid calls to sensitive functions, which could potentially be exploited.

## **Conclusion:**
